# Flexbox sticky footer

[Demo](https://rawgit.com/rofrol/flexbox-footer/master/index.html)

push item to bottom

The footer has `margin-top: auto`, because there is situation that elements can be added automatically before footer, but footer still has to be at the bottom. Also I don't want to add wrapper that would be expanding.
